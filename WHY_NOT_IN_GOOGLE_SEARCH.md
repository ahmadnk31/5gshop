## Understanding How Google Search Works

### Phase 1: Discovery (Days 1-3)
**What happens:** Google's bots find your website
- You add new content/keywords → ✅ Done today
- Google bot needs to visit your site → ⏳ Takes 1-3 days
- **Action needed:** Submit sitemap to Google Search Console

### Phase 2: Crawling (Days 3-7)
**What happens:** Google reads all your pages
- Google bot visits every page on your site
- Reads all text, keywords, titles, descriptions
- Analyzes your content quality
- **Speed up:** Request indexing in Search Console

### Phase 3: Indexing (Days 7-14)
**What happens:** Google adds your pages to their database
- Google decides if your content is valuable
- Stores your pages in their search database
- Makes your site searchable (but not ranked yet)
- **Check:** Search "site:5gphones.be macbook repair"

### Phase 4: Ranking (Weeks 2-6)
**What happens:** Google decides WHERE to show your site
- Compares your site to competitors
- Considers: content quality, backlinks, reviews, site speed
- Your position improves as you gain authority
- **Goal:** Rank on page 1 (top 10 results)

## Common Questions

### "Can I pay Google to rank #1 immediately?"
**No.** Google's organic results can't be bought. You CAN:
- Pay for Google Ads (appears above organic results)
- Speed up process with Search Console + Reviews
- But organic ranking takes time (2-6 weeks minimum)

### "My competitor ranks #1 after 1 day!"
**Unlikely.** They probably:
- Had the site for months before adding keywords
- Built backlinks and reviews over time
- Are using paid Google Ads (not organic results)

### "How do I know if my keywords are good?"
**Check Google Keyword Planner:**
1. Go to: https://ads.google.com/keyword-planner
2. Search: "macbook repair leuven"
3. Look at "Average monthly searches"
   - 10-100 searches = Good local keyword
   - 100-1000 searches = Competitive
   - 1000+ searches = Very competitive

Your keywords are PERFECT for local SEO:
- "macbook repair leuven" - Low competition
- "laptop reparatie leuven" - Low competition  
- "réparation ipad louvain" - Very low competition

### "Do I need a blog?"
**Nice to have, not required.** Helps with:
- More keywords → more pages indexed
- Shows expertise → better ranking
- Keeps site fresh → Google likes that

**Minimum:** Add 1 blog post per month about repairs
