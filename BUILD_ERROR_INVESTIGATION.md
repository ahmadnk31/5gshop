# Build Error Investigation Summary

## 🔍 **Current Status: "self is not defined" persists**

Despite multiple fix attempts, the error continues:
```
unhandledRejection ReferenceError: self is not defined
at Object.<anonymous> (.next/server/vendor.js:1:1)
```

## ✅ **Fixes Already Applied**

1. **API Routes Fixed**:
   - ✅ `app/api/search/repairs/route.ts` - Dynamic Fuse.js import
   - ✅ `app/api/search/accessories/route.ts` - Dynamic Fuse.js import

2. **Component Fixes**:
   - ✅ `components/structured-data.tsx` - Removed unnecessary `'use client'`
   - ✅ `lib/google-analytics.ts` - Removed `'use client'`, added browser checks
   - ✅ `components/leaflet-map.tsx` - Temporarily disabled Leaflet imports

3. **Next.js Config**:
   - ✅ Added webpack externals for problematic libraries
   - ✅ Added DefinePlugin for `self` polyfill
   - ✅ Disabled package import optimizations

## 🤔 **Remaining Suspects**

Since obvious culprits have been addressed, the issue might be:

1. **Hidden Import Chain**: A library importing another library that accesses `self`
2. **Build-time Static Generation**: Pages being statically generated that import client code
3. **Third-party Library Bug**: One of the dependencies has a server-side bug
4. **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: Potential compatibility issue with Next.js 15.3.4

## 🔧 **Next Debugging Steps**

### Option 1: Nuclear Approach
Temporarily remove ALL potentially problematic dependencies:
```bash
npm uninstall leaflet react-leaflet fuse.js react-confetti recharts framer-motion
```

### Option 2: Dependency Analysis
Check which exact dependency is causing the issue:
```bash
npm ls | grep -E "(leaflet|fuse|confetti|recharts|framer)"
```

### Option 3: Build with Minimal Config
Create a minimal `next.config.ts` with only essential settings.

### Option 4: Downgrade Next.js
Test with Next.js 14 to see if it's a version-specific issue.

## 📋 **Current Next Steps**
1. Try the nuclear approach first
2. If that works, re-add dependencies one by one
3. Identify the exact culprit
4. Apply targeted fix
