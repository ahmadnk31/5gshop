# ✅ SOLVED: "self is not defined" Build Error

## 🎯 **Root Cause Identified**
The error was caused by **Fuse.js being imported directly in API routes**:
- `app/api/search/repairs/route.ts`
- `app/api/search/accessories/route.ts`

API routes are executed during Next.js build time for static generation, and Fuse.js library tries to access the `self` global, which doesn't exist in Node.js environment.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### Before (❌ Causing Build Error):
```typescript
import Fuse from 'fuse.js';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // Fuse is loaded at build time
}
```

### After (✅ Build Success):
```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // Dynamically import Fuse.js to prevent build-time issues
  const Fuse = (await import('fuse.js')).default;
  // Fuse is only loaded when the API is called
}
```

## 📊 **Impact**
- ✅ **Build Success**: No more "self is not defined" errors
- ✅ **Performance**: Dynamic imports only load when needed
- ✅ **Functionality**: Search API works exactly the same
- ✅ **Deployment**: Vercel builds will now succeed

## 🧠 **Key Learning**
When using browser-compatible libraries in API routes, always use dynamic imports to prevent build-time execution in the Node.js environment.

## 🚀 **Additional Optimizations Applied**
1. **Webpack Externals**: Excluded problematic libraries from server bundle
2. **Self Polyfill**: Added webpack DefinePlugin for additional safety
3. **Dynamic Imports**: Made all browser-specific code load dynamically
