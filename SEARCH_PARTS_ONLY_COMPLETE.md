# Search Functionality Updated - Parts Only

## Summary
Successfully modified the search functionality to only return available replacement parts for purchase, completely removing repair services from search results.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Endpoint Modification
**File:** `/app/api/search/repairs/route.ts`
- **Purpose:** Completely redesigned to search only replacement parts
- **Key Changes:**
  - Removed all repair service search logic
  - Implemented parts-only search with device model correlation
  - Added stock filtering (`part.inStock > 0`) to ensure only available parts are shown
  - Enhanced scoring system for better relevance (90 for exact device+part match, 30 for universal parts)
  - All results now link to part detail pages (`/accessories/${part.id}`)

### 2. Search Component Updates
**File:** `/components/search-component.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Updated frontend search component to handle parts-only results
- **Key Changes:**
  - Modified `SearchFilter` type from `'all' | 'repairs' | 'accessories'` to `'all' | 'parts'`
  - Updated `SearchResult` interface to only handle `type: 'accessory'`
  - Simplified search function to only call parts API endpoint
  - Updated filter dropdown to show "Available Parts" and "All Parts" options
  - Changed placeholder text to "Search replacement parts..."
  - Updated search button to redirect to accessories page for all searches
  - Removed repair service logic from icon and result display functions
  - Updated Badge component to always show "Part" for consistency

## Search Logic

### Database Query
```typescript
// Only searches parts table with device model correlation
parts.forEach((part: any) => {
  // Match part names, device models, brands
  // Score: 90 (exact device+part) → 30 (universal part)
  if (matchScore > 0 && part.inStock > 0) {
    // Only include in-stock parts
  }
});
```

### Stock Filtering
- **Critical Feature:** Only parts with `part.inStock > 0` are returned
- **User Benefit:** Users only see parts they can actually purchase
- **Business Impact:** Prevents frustration from out-of-stock items in search

### Result Format
```json
{
  "id": "part-cmc6vh4sa0011sbvp1te6plvd",
  "name": "Samsung Galaxy S23 Samsung Galaxy S23 Screen",
  "price": 79.99,
  "category": "Replacement Part",
  "inStock": 8,
  "url": "/accessories/cmc6vh4sa0011sbvp1te6plvd"
}
```

## Testing Results

### Samsung Search Test
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/repairs?q=samsung"
```
**Result:** Returns 1 part (Samsung Galaxy S23 Screen, $79.99, 8 in stock)

### iPhone Search Test
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/repairs?q=iphone"
```
**Result:** Returns 10 iPhone parts (various models, all in stock)

### Repair Service Test
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/repairs?q=screen+repair"
```
**Result:** Returns `[]` (no repair services, as intended)

### Parts Search Test
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search/repairs?q=screen"
```
**Result:** Returns screen replacement parts only

## Bug Fixes

### ✅ Name Duplication Issue (FIXED)
**Problem:** Part names were being duplicated (e.g., "Samsung Galaxy S23 Samsung Galaxy S23 Screen")

**Root Cause:** The search API was concatenating device name with part name, but part names already contained device information

**Solution:** Implemented smart name detection logic:
```typescript
// Check if part name already contains the device model
const modelInPartName = partNameLower.includes(deviceModel.toLowerCase());

// Only prepend device name if the part name doesn't contain the model
if (!modelInPartName) {
  displayName = `${deviceFullName} ${part.name}`;
}
```

**Test Results:**
- Samsung search now correctly returns: "Samsung Galaxy S23 Screen" ✅
- iPhone search now correctly returns: "iPhone 14 Battery" ✅
- No more name duplication issues ✅

## User Experience Impact

### Before
- Search returned both repair services and replacement parts
- Users could find repair bookings and parts mixed together
- Confusing experience with different action paths

### After
- Search only returns replacement parts available for purchase
- Clean, focused shopping experience
- All results lead to part detail pages where users can buy
- Consistent part availability (all results are in stock)

## Business Benefits

1. **Focused Shopping Experience**
   - Users can easily find parts to purchase
   - No confusion between repair bookings and part purchases
   - Streamlined conversion funnel

2. **Inventory Management**
   - Only in-stock items appear in search
   - Reduces customer frustration
   - Better inventory turnover

3. **Clear User Intent**
   - Search is now purpose-built for parts purchasing
   - Separate repair booking flow remains intact
   - Better user journey separation

## Technical Implementation Notes

### API Endpoint

- Modified internal logic completely while maintaining API contract
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### Frontend Integration
